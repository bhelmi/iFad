Description: This package implements a Bayesian sparse factor model for the joint analysis of paired datasets, one is the gene expression dataset and the other is the drug sensitivity profiles, measured across the same panel of samples, e.g., cell lines. Prior knowledge about gene-pathway associations can be easily incorporated in the model to aid the inference of drug-pathway associations.
